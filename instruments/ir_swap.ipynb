    "\n",
    "The most common type of an interest rate swap is the so called \"plain vanilla\" interest rate swap. Here, a company agrees to pay cashflows equal to a predetermined fixed interest rate on a notional principal during a predetermined number of years; in return, it receives interest payments on the same notional principal at a floating rate during the same number of years.\n"

    "## Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a swap can, for example, be regarded as the difference between two bonds. From the point of view of a fixed-rate payer, the value of the swap can be regarded as a long position in a floating-rate bond and a short position in a fixed-rate bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{swap} = B_{float} - B_{fix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a plain vanilla interest rate swap can also be valued making the assumption that forward interest rates are realized. Here, cashflows of the floating leg are calculated assuming that the floating interest rate equals the forward interest rates. The value of the interest rate swap is then the sum of the present value of the net cashflows. This method will be applied in the following.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following, we will use a slighly modified example taken from Hull, p. 161 to illustrate how a interest rate swap can be valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suppose that a financial institution has agreed to pay 6-month LIBOR and receive 8% per annum (with semiannual compounding) on a notional principal of \\$100 million. The swap has a remaining life of 1.5 years. The LIBOR rates with continuous compunding for 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month maturities are 10%, 10.5%, and 11%, respectively.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valuation in terms of bond prices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed Leg**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed-rate bond has three payment dates in 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months with a cashflow of \\$4 million at the first two payment dates and a cashflow of \\$4 million plus the notional of $100 million at the last payment date. These cashflows have to be discounted using the given LIBOR rates and subsequently summed up to receive the present value of the fixed leg.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Floating Leg**\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating leg bond is worth the notional immediately after an interest payment because at this time, the bond is a \"fair deal\" where the borower pays LIBOR for earch subsequent accrual period. Consequently, immediately before a payment, the bond is worth the notional plus the accrued interest. Also, this cashflow has to be discounted using the given LIBOR rate."
