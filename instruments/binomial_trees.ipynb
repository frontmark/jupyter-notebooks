    "## Application of binomial trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial trees are a popular technique for pricing options. This method relies on the asumption that stock prices follow a random walk and at each time step, it has a certain probability of moving up or down by a certain percentage. Furthermore, it requires the assumption that no arbitrage opportunities exist. The binomial tree represents the different paths a stock price can follow. In the limit, this model converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, which is described [here](EuropeanPlainValinnaOption.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example - One-step binomial tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a stock which currently trades at 50. We are interested in pricing a European call option with a a strike of 50 and maturity in six months from now. We know that at maturity, the stock will either move up to 55 or move down to 45. Hence, if the stock price moves up, the option will have a value of 5; if the stock price moves down, the option will have the value zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a risk neutral world, we can set up a portfolio of the stock itself and the option so that we already know the value of the portfolio at maturity. Therefore, we need to calculate the delta of shares we need to hold to make the portfolio riskless. We can calculate delta as \n",

    "$$\\Delta=\\frac{c_u-c_d}{S_0u-S_0d},$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $c_u$ and $c_d$ is the value of the option assuming the stock moves up respectively down and $S_0u$ and $S_0d$ is the value of the stock if it moves up respectively down. Hence, delta is given as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta=\\frac{5-0}{55-45}=0.5.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can create a riskless portfolio by holding a long position in $\\Delta$ shares and short one call option. If the stock price moves up to 55, the value of the portfolio is $55\\cdot0.5-5=22.5$; if the stock price moves down to 45, the value of the portfolio is $45\\cdot0.5-0=22.5$.
