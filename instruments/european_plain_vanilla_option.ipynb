    "\n",
    "Since the volatility in the option pricing formulas cannot be directly observed, one usually works with implied volatilities. Implied volatilities are the volatilities implied by option prices observed in the market. As it is not possible to invert the Black-Scholes-Merton or Black-76 formulas so that the volatility is expressed as a function of the other parameters, one needs to use an interactive search procedure.\n",
