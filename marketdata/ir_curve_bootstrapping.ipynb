    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce the basic principles of multi-curve bootstrapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the credit crisis a single-curve framework was used for pricing interest rate derivatives. Both the forecasting of future cashflows as well as the discounting of future cashflows was based on the same curve. This curve was considered to be risk-free and was bootstrapped using a mixture of instruments indexed to rates with different tenors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the crisis, however, a widening of the spreads in tenor basis swaps has been observed. As a result, two interest rate swaps indexed e.g. to the 3M EURIBOR and 6M EURIBOR can no longer be priced using the same curve. Furthermore, a distinction needs to be made between the curve for the forward rates and the discount curve. This has led to the introduction of the multi-curve framework with separate curves for each tenor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the multi-curve setup the curves are constructed based on instruments homogeneous in the referenced index. A set of instruments needs to be selected for each curve, with one instrument per maturity. Each instrument requires a quote as well as the respective instrument defintion, which is called a specification in the context of pyvacon."
